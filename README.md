# create_drupal
A script that creates a new Drupal 8 site and sets some settings that I always have to do by hand otherwise

You should have drush installed - on my local I am testing it with Drush 8

Also I have my Drupal environment set up according to this (https://echo.co/blog/os-x-1010-yosemite-local-development-environment-apache-php-and-mysql-homebrew) , 
which makes sence to have the script running in your Sites folder, and after running it - you will have a full, working
Drupal 8 website, with some good practices already implemented.
